Data Mining
===========

Code related to the projects of my data minign course. Each individual work will be on a package:

* tp[1-7]

The final project will be one:

* project

Common code will be a the base package.

Dependency
==========

Base dependencies:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* scikits-learn (see bellow)

This code makes use of bleeding edge version of some packages. You will need to install
them by hand:

* scikits-learn (http://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

Some code was copied from Scipy's repository also (need not be installed). 
Hopefully, on the next release of scikits-learn and scipy we will have the 
functionality needed by default.
